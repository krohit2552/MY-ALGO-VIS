In summary, this is a React-based website that serves as a visualization platform for various searching and sorting algorithms. It provides a navigation bar, algorithm boxes with images and descriptions, a live clock, and a footer. Additionally, it includes functionality for smooth scrolling to anchor elements when certain links are clicked.

Based on the provided code, I have covered the following algorithms:

Searching Algorithms:

Linear Search
Binary Search
Ternary Search
Sorting Algorithms:

Bubble Sort
Quick Sort
Insertion Sort
Scheduling Algorithms:

First-Come, First-Served (FCFS)
Shortest Job Next (SJN) or Shortest Job First (SJF)
Priority Scheduling
Round Robin (RR)
Multi-Level Queue Scheduling
Multi-Level Feedback Queue Scheduling
Highest Response Ratio Next (HRRN)
Hosting and Backend Information:

The site is hosted on Netlify and can be accessed via this link.
The backend is implemented using Node.js, and a mailer service is used to receive feedback from users.
